# data-structures-exercises

A series of katas to learn the fundamentals of Computer Science data structures, whilst also learning Clojure :D 

## Installation

Download the project from:
`git@github.com:charlottebrf/cs-fundamentals.git`

## Usage
Run the Clojure Tests:

`cd data-structures-exercises
lein test`

## Description
The first kata, fifo, explores the concept of [queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)). It creates and manages the size of its queues via custom methods: to create a new queue, check its size, pop and push functions. 
`fifo-pop` replicates a [first in first out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) function.
`lifo-pop` replicates a [last in first out](https://techterms.com/definition/filo) function.
